Input Format

Most of the input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor.

In the void Student::input() function, you must read 5 scores from stdin and save them to your scores instance variable.

Output Format

In the int Student::calculateTotalScore() function, you must return the student's total grade (the sum of the values in scores).

The locked code in the editor will determine how many scores are larger than Kristen's and print that number to the console.

Sample Input

The first line contains n, the number of students in Kristen's class. The n subsequent lines contain each student's 5 exam grades for this semester.
